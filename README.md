Project Overview-

Amidst declining crop production in recent years, a pressing concern for farmers, I spearheaded the development of a streamlined Power BI dashboard.
This project is a comprehensive endeavor, involving an in-depth analysis and presentation of various crucial aspects related to crop yield production. The primary aim is to offer invaluable insights and actionable recommendations to improve crop yield production for farmers. 
Firstly ETL(extract, transform ,load) performed on dataset through this the data is readable and relevant according to our project. 

Ultimately creating a robust dashboard for analysis to gain valuable insights or to visually analyze crop yield production, highlighting key seasonal trends for farmers and presenting valuable information.
Leveraged PowerBI query for data cleaning, transform, and analyze over 10,000 rows of agricultural data before integrating it into Power BI for insightful analysis.
Identified and presented actionable insights, focusing on three key performance indicators (KPIs) to optimize crop growth and improve farmers' overall performance.
